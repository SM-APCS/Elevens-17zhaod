1. The only possible moves are to remove one of the two fives and the six.

2. Yes because cards A-10 are always removed in pairs and royals removed in triplets.
Since there are an even number of A-10 cards and multiple of 3 amount of royals
in the beginning, they must always stay even/multiple of 3. The only legal way to
obtain three cards left then is 0 (A-10) and 3 (royals). Also, since royals must
be removed in a triplet of a J, Q, and K, the last three cards must be this triplet.

3. No strategy. Each card only pairs with one other type of card so the game is 
completely luck based (whether or not the cards dealt can create moves).
